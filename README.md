# Yeswanth Chandrasekhar Portfolio

This project is a personal website built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my experience, skills and projects.

## Live Site

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the site during development.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

Ensure the `homepage` field in `package.json` points to your repository URL. Then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the project and publishes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch so the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
